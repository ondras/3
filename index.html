				This page creates 3D models that cast shadows in the shapes of three letters. You can customize the letters,
				interact with created models and download them for e.g. 3D printing. These <em>shadow cubes</em> are
				known from the cover of the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach</a> book.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that the models are created server-side and the process can take up to 10 seconds, based on many factors.
				Up to 12 distinct configurations will be generated for every three letters. Please be patient.
